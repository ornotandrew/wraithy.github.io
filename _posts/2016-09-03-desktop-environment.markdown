title:  "Desktop environments"
---

If you spend 8+ hours a day working in a particular space, it's pretty important
that it's comfortable and allows you to be productive. If you spend a lot of
time driving with your seat too close to the wheel, your back will start
hurting. If your office is filled with with crappy stationary, you'll end up
frustrated with pens containing gravity-defying ink and staplers which are only
good for making holes in paper.

This sounds pretty dumb, right? Just move the seat back. Buy better stationary.
These examples are trivial and can be fixed with almost no effort. The thing is,
computer interfaces are <s>arguably</s> just as important but users often settle
for the default option, even when there are alternatives.

Let me digress a bit, and explain what I mean by "Desktop environment".  The
[Wikipaedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) talks
about the icon, window and toolbar metaphors (although you might not want to
read too closely or you'll find
[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)) page). To me, a good DE
is defined by workflows rather than specific elements. It should have:

+ The ability to launch apps with minimal friction
+ Window management that doesn't get overwhelming as I open an increasing number
  of apps
+ An area to represent background apps which don't always have their own window
+ A way to group windows into separate workspaces
+ A notification system which gets my attention without being irritating
+ Controls and feedback for volume, brightness etc.
+ The ability to tuck itself away, giving complete focus to the app I'm working on

+ Personal history Have tried a few. By no means all, but enough to understand
  what's out there.
    + KDE
    + Cinnamon
    + Unity
    + Gnome3
    + Pantheon
    + i3
    + Even [LiteStep](http://litestep.info/) on Windows

+ Elements I like
    + Pantheon - Slingshot
    + Unity - slim top bar, like OSX

+ I chose Unity
    + Stock is actually pretty good
    + How to make it even better
        + Themes - Numix, Paper Icons
        + dconf
+ Options for non-linux users
    + Alfred
    + Clipboard managers
