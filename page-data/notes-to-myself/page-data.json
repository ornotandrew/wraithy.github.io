In\nfact, if you were to look through my Facebook/Twitter timelines right now, you\nwould find a bursting collection of “not much”.</p>\n<p>This is just <em>who I am</em>. I have always preferred to consume writing rather than\ngenerate it. I spend a healthy amount of time reading books, and an unhealthy\namount of time sifting through Hacker News and Reddit. So, starting a “blog” is\ncertainly unusual for me.</p>\n<h2>Then why?</h2>\n<p>Recently, I’ve found myself thinking about something specific and wanting to\nrecord it somewhere. Not for other people to read, but rather to help get my\nthoughts in order and maintain an archive, in case I need to come back to that\ntrain of thought in the future. At first I looked into note-taking tools like\nEvernote, but ended up leaning towards keeping my own set of markdown files.\nThat became a Jekyll blog hosted with Github pages, which in turn led me here.\nI see this as an opportunity for me to organize my thoughts, and openly take\nstock of lessons I’ve learned. If people read what I post — great. If they\ndon’t — at least I will.</p>\n<p>I don’t have a particular plan for what I’ll be writing, but it will likely\ninvolve</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Programming environments</strong> — Mostly Vim, but also general workflows inside\na terminal</li>\n<li><strong>Tooling around programming for the cloud</strong> — Specifically CI/CD, Docker and\nGoogle Cloud Platform</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There will be code snippets. There will be diagrams. There will be opinions.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes to myself","date":"February 15, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/notes-to-myself/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/desktop-environments/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Desktop Environments"}}}}}
