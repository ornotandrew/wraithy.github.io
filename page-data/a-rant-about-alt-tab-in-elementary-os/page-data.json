It’s mostly\ngreat, but the alt+tab functionality gets under my skin. My level of\nfrustration has been enough to send me Googling for ways to change the default\nbehaviour, but not enough to do anything constructive about it. I suppose this\nshould end up as a <a href=\"https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&#x26;q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Aelementary+label%3A%22Needs+Design%22\">“Needs design”\nissue</a>,\nbut at the time of this post I happened to feel like ranting, so I did that\ninstead. Below is that rant — you have been warned. It details some specifics\nabout why I think alt+tab in elementary OS is broken.</p>\n<h2>The search for a fix</h2>\n<p>First of all, there are plenty of complaints about this. There didn’t seem to\nbe any solutions on the discussions I found, but what disappointed me was that\nin many of those threads, the responses were defensive — comments like “I don’t\nreally know why you would want something other than what we have now”.</p>\n<p>Seriously? From my perspective, alt+tab switching is hands down the worst part\nof elementary OS. It frustrates me <em>literally</em> every time I use it. I’d say\nthat from a UX standpoint, it breaks continuity in more than one big way.</p>\n<p>For reference, below is a short video of me switching through a typical set of\nopen windows.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ta7itUYlLvk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<h2>The dock in general</h2>\n<p>I appreciate the idea of overloading the dock, and I think it could work, but\nIt needs more design. Plank only shows you the currently open apps while\nalt-tabbing, and this can be jarring if the number of apps you have open is\nvery different from the number you have pinned.</p>\n<p>In the extreme case, when you alt+tab your “dock” suddenly looks very different\n— so much so that it takes my brain a split second to register it as “my dock”.\nThis is confusing because although the two different modes provide completely\ndifferent functionality, they look <em>kind of</em> the same. I mean this in the sense\nthat they are both in the same area of the screen and have the same background,\nbut show a different list of apps and have different widths. The change in\nwidth is the real culprit for me here — I have many apps pinned, so if I only\nhave three or four apps open, hitting alt+tab makes my dock do a vanishing act.\nThis confusion is compounded by the fact that I auto-hide my dock.</p>\n<p>If it was my choice, I would either stop overloading the dock or make it work\nmore like the current alt+esc functionality (except of course it would cycle\nthrough all apps instead of the most recent two).</p>\n<h2>The window fly-in/out animations</h2>\n<p>I like animations which are applied tastefully and don’t get in the way. But\nlet’s look at what the alt-tab switcher is supposed to do…</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 27.999999999999996%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAIAAABM9SnKAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABeUlEQVQY0wFuAZH+AExUZUtSX0VPYFxbXqWQecLFyMfGxsvNz760q4l3Xm1nWZN5W+q4fuG2iLuefMaYa+Kxcd2yd8aedLWUbgAtPFozQV0oOVckMEVzdHH////+/fv9////8995Y0saIikuMDBuXkl9Z1FQTEaLhIPXw7Dq2b/l0sHfxawAMD1RNUBPQExfOURUYmhr3N3eyMnIxsrN2cm3a1U/Cw0PFxYWCg0RBwoNFxofTFtw2ODm9fr+7/n/7eLXABgiKB4pLbK1td7c3dnZ28DFylFWVjo/QDM4OSUmJRcXFxoaGhsbGxoZGBwfIEVJUeHg4f///v///8TDwgAMFR8LFyDLztD////////p6usyPUMNFx4GDxgHDhUOFhoSGiEUHiUWISYXIyokMDhHUVdIUFdES1EsMjkACxQcCRMcU1ticnN2cXN2ZG1zFyIrCBIaBQsRAwgPBxEZChQdChUeDhojEh8pER4nCRYfBBAZAAcPAAEHHuuUYI+9Z/4AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Window overview via super+a\"\n        title=\"_Window overview via super+a_\"\n        src=\"/static/82db7eeb88a089f6f975392d936bea5a/00d43/super-a.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/82db7eeb88a089f6f975392d936bea5a/63868/super-a.png 250w,\n/static/82db7eeb88a089f6f975392d936bea5a/0b533/super-a.png 500w,\n/static/82db7eeb88a089f6f975392d936bea5a/00d43/super-a.png 1000w,\n/static/82db7eeb88a089f6f975392d936bea5a/aa440/super-a.png 1500w,\n/static/82db7eeb88a089f6f975392d936bea5a/e8950/super-a.png 2000w,\n/static/82db7eeb88a089f6f975392d936bea5a/21f0c/super-a.png 3842w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"><p><em>Window overview via super+a</em></p></figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>In my opinion, alt+tab should be a quicker version of the window\noverview/expose/super+a. I should be able to get a quick, general overview of\nhow many things I have open, and at a glance be able to tell how many times I\nshould tap tab to get to the one I want. If the number of open apps is small\nenough, the first time I cycle through them should provide me with a mental\nmodel of their order, so next time I know how many times to cycle without even\nhaving to see the list.</p>\n<p>Having an animation as grand as the current one breaks any mental model that I\nhave in my head. It’s generally disorienting, and worse, the chosen animation\nmakes it look like the apps are moving (coming and going from the centre of the\nscreen) as you cycle. I don’t want to have to do extra work by trying to\nmentally block out the animation to keep my mental model consistent.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 62.4%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Minimize on MacOS\"\n        title=\"Minimize on MacOS\"\n        src=\"/static/6218d6bb3f77e6d89e399c1f5b93e30a/a2510/macos-minimize.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6218d6bb3f77e6d89e399c1f5b93e30a/0479a/macos-minimize.jpg 250w,\n/static/6218d6bb3f77e6d89e399c1f5b93e30a/41099/macos-minimize.jpg 500w,\n/static/6218d6bb3f77e6d89e399c1f5b93e30a/a2510/macos-minimize.jpg 1000w,\n/static/6218d6bb3f77e6d89e399c1f5b93e30a/c58a3/macos-minimize.jpg 1500w,\n/static/6218d6bb3f77e6d89e399c1f5b93e30a/3acf0/macos-minimize.jpg 2000w,\n/static/6218d6bb3f77e6d89e399c1f5b93e30a/1b92a/macos-minimize.jpg 3360w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>I know it’s for a different operation, but a good example of how to to this\nproperly is the minimize/maximize animation in the macOS dock.</p>\n<p>They use an animation that goes out of its way to map how the app fits into the\nbigger picture.</p>\n<p>The fly-in/out animation on elementary OS does the opposite — it provides no\nactual value, and just adds more cognitive load.</p>\n<h2>Multi-monitor</h2>\n<p>This one is really simple.</p>\n<p><strong>A)</strong> Plank on elementary defaults to having one dock — on the main screen</p>\n<p><strong>B)</strong> Plank is used as the alt+tab switcher</p>\n<p>I don’t disagree with either of these choices, but they can’t be used together.\nPick one and move on from there.</p>\n<p>I primarily use two screens.
